## Chapter 2: Drakmar Pass & Outskirt

The party was travelling north through **Drakmar Pass** toward Outskirt when they came upon a man collapsed on the road. A pool of blackened blood spread beneath him, and a poisoned arrow protruded from his back.

As **Grim** approached, the pale, dying man thrust a bundle into his hands and urgently whispered:
*“Quick, take it! Leanara will understand… message from the Master Weatherman… must find all four pieces… the secret of the Dragon Emperor!”*
Moments later, the man died.

Almost immediately, the party was ambushed—goblins closed in from both the front and the rear. **Golden** stepped forward to block three goblins from reaching the others, while **Arasin** circled around to engage a fourth. **Grim** fought two goblins near the fallen man while coming under arrow fire from two goblin archers positioned at a distance. **Moby** slipped behind one of the goblins attacking **Grim** and struck with a precise backstab, while **Munin** charged in with an axe against one of the goblins threatening **Golden**.

The battle escalated when a goblin riding a worg burst from behind a boulder ahead of the party, barking orders as he charged **Moby** with a spear. **Moby** managed to parry the attack and retreat before the rider could strike again. **Sorilea** then unleashed a fireball, which ultimately brought down the worg rider and ended the fight.

After the battle, the party examined the contents of the bundle: a strange object and a map. They noticed that the object was depicted in the lower-left corner of the map, alongside three other similar symbols in the remaining corners—strongly suggesting that the bundle contained one of four pieces.

Continuing on to Outskirt, the party persuaded the guards at the gate to let them enter. Inside, **Captain Hardy** welcomed them and directed them to the **Three Stags Inn**. In the town square, they noticed an ancient statue at the center—and realized that the object they carried closely resembled the statue’s base.

At the Three Stags, they were warmly greeted by **Vagnhild**, who offered them mead on the house. They also ordered roasted boar. **Annabella** served their meal and answered several of their questions. When the party mentioned the mark and the strange object, **Annabella** advised them to meet her later that night, after her shift ended.

During their stay, **Grim** attempted to speak with a lady knight, but she ignored him—and also brushed off **Sorilea**, who tried to intervene.

Leaving the inn, the party explored the town. They visited **The Twins** blacksmith, hoping to purchase weapons and armour, but quickly realized their funds were limited. Still, they ensured that everyone at least had basic protection, such as leather armour.

Their final stop was **Dranath’s Hut**, thick with smoke inside. **Dranath** shared ancient lore of the Misty Vale and spoke of **Um-Durman**, the Sword of Eledain, once wielded by the Dragon Emperor. He revealed that three factions were racing to collect the four-part key needed to open the crypt where Um-Durman rests:
**The Keepers of the Immaculate Flame**, **the Followers of Sathmog**, and **Chief Maladuk’s orc forces**.

With this knowledge—and one piece of the key already in their possession—the party realised they had become part of a much larger and far more dangerous struggle.
