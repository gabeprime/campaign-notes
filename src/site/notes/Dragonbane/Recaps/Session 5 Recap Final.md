## Chapter 5: Into Bothild’s Lode

The party set out from **Outskirt Village** toward **Bothild’s Lode**, following Dranath’s advice. Legend says Bothild the Vile and Greedy once mined there, unearthing both treasures and nameless horrors.  

### Journey to Bothild’s Lode
- They lost their way twice: first blocked by rocks and fallen trees, which they climbed rather than build Munin’s proposed ladder; then through a mosquito-ridden swamp, saved from discomfort by their cloaks.  
- They hunted and gathered along the way, conserving rations.  
- At their first rest stop, a **griffon** attacked, though **Grim** slept through it.  
- At their second, they met **Sephyra**, a storm-calling elementalist. Initially indifferent, she warmed to them, taught **Sorilea** the spell *Whirlwind* (for 4 gold), and safely guided them to the mines.  

### The Gates of Bothild’s Lode
- The mine entrance lay at the base of a cliff, guarded by goblins peering through narrow holes.  
- Choosing the main gate, they found its ruined runes defaced with graffiti: *White Death’s Triumph*, *Greed’s Price*, *Glittergrubber’s Folly*.  
- Inside, a sloping corridor bore deep wagon ruts. A portcullis hung half-open, with arrow slits above. **Grim** led the way, avoiding the arrow trap, and the rest followed.  
- Munin dismantled the inner door, revealing **Bothild’s Square**: a vast cavern under a false night sky, dominated by a headless statue with axe raised. Fourteen goblins waited.  

Mention of **Grub**, the goblin they had saved, persuaded the guards to let them pass to seek **Maladuk**, the orc chieftain.  

### Exploring the Flooded Tunnels
- The party waded through damp, musty passages adorned with dwarven carvings. To search for treasure, they tied a rope to **Moby**, sending him diving despite his poor swimming skills. He nearly drowned several times but surfaced with silver and gold coins.  
- Eventually, they reached an arched gateway where a great chain plunged into the water. There, they encountered the blurred **ghost of Bothild**, bearing a mortal wound from the White Death. She promised treasure and a key fragment to Um-Durman if they slew the beast.  

### The White Death
- The White Death, a massive pale sea serpent with milky eyes and curved horns, ambushed **Golden**. Despite its terrifying roar, the party quickly brought it down with teamwork.  
- Munin recovered Bothild’s **Golden Axe** from its belly. **Arasin** presented the serpent’s head to the ghost, who guided them deeper into the mine.  

### Bothild’s Tomb
- She led them to a half-submerged chamber marked by a carved dwarf holding axe and silver apple. A secret room lay beyond.  
- Inside: a sarcophagus, trapped but safely disarmed, along with coins, tools, and two rune-inscribed stones:  
  - *Reditus sum* (“I have returned”)  
  - *Ancora* (“Anchor”)  
- They also recovered another **statuette piece** for the Um-Durman key—but discovered it was a duplicate of the pedestal-and-feet piece they already had. One was genuine, one a fake—potentially useful for deceiving rivals.  

### Meeting Maladuk
- Pressing further, they found **Maladuk** and two orcs arguing by a rune-carved furnace stinking of charred flesh. At first hostile, Maladuk’s group attacked, but after one orc was slain, Grim persuaded Maladuk to talk.  
- She revealed that orcs and goblins secretly rule the valley, striving to stop the followers of the demon **Azrahel Koth** from gathering the statuette pieces.  
- They agreed to ally: messages could be exchanged via any orc or goblin, using the phrase *“we have kissed Maladuk”* to prove allegiance.  
- Maladuk directed them to a nearby cave exit into the Kummer Mountains, sparing them further danger in the tunnels.
