## Chapter 1: The Castle of the Robber Knight

For two days, the party had wandered the wilds, drawn ever closer to their destination. At last, they stood before the ruined **Castle of the Robber Knight**, its crumbling walls perched atop a grassy hill. The warm glow of an inn’s fire seemed like a distant dream as the old woman’s warning echoed in their minds:

_"Many have sought the lost treasures of Rothgar Wolfsbane. None have returned."_

But this band of adventurers had no intention of turning back.

### A Treacherous Approach

As they trudged along the solid path, Moby’s sharp eyes caught a glint of metal. With characteristic curiosity, he approached and retrieved a **horned helmet**, its twisted spikes giving it a menacing appearance. Meanwhile, Grim’s keen instincts led him to a concealed trail behind the shrubs—perhaps a hidden route for those who wished to move unseen.

Reaching the castle’s gates, they made a fatal mistake: **they did not check for traps**.

Grim triggered a tripwire, sending a silent signal to unseen watchers. In the shadows of the ruins, **goblins prepared an ambush**. Moments later, Grim and Golden nearly plummeted into a hidden pit, escaping only by sheer luck.

Near the eastern side of the courtyard, a **heavy wooden cellar door** drew their attention. Before Munin could smash it down with her axe, the skies **erupted into a torrential downpour**, reducing visibility. Ariana conjured a soft glow on the stairs, sparing the need for torches.

### The Prisoner in the Cellar

Descending into the damp cellar, the group met **Gruntha**, a captured orc who revealed the goblin leader’s sinister plans. She had been forced to blow a magic horn that would summon **the ghost of Rothgar Wolfsbane**, now a wight. She pleaded for aid—not only for herself but also for her beloved pet pig, **Merle**.

A deeper search revealed **a chained skeleton**, clutching an aged scroll bearing the name **Embarius** and a painted portrait of a man. The mystery deepened.

When they emerged from the cellar, the goblins were waiting.

### The Goblin Ambush

From behind a gnarled **dead tree at the heart of the courtyard**, **ten goblins sprang forth**, weapons glinting in the rain.

- Sorilea unleashed a **gust of wind**, sending goblins tumbling.
- Ariana became the group's lifeline, **healing wounds** while summoning **lightning** against their foes.
- Golden took blow after blow, his **Guardian** skill deflecting attacks—but at an unexpected cost of **two silver per blocked strike**.
- Grim marked one goblin as his **prey**, using his hunter’s prowess to land brutal strikes.
- Moby attempted **backstabs**, while Arasin held a goblin in a tense standoff.
- Munin **hacked away with her axe**, splintering bone and flesh.

As their numbers dwindled, the last three goblins fled into the darkness. One escaped. Their leader remained unseen.

### Secrets of the Castle

With the battle over, the party searched the ruins.

- **Moby found Merle**, the pig, inside a tower by the stairs.
- Grim and Munin spotted **a raven’s nest** resting just beyond reach on a **broken stone staircase**. Climbing carefully, they reached their prize… only to find **three rusted nails**.
- Moby and Golden attempted **swimming in a murky pond**. Moby kept **floating uselessly**, while Golden was **dragged down beneath the water**—a near disaster that turned to fortune. Below, he discovered **two treasures worth 80 silver** and another **horned helmet**, this one with a **purple tinge** and an engraving: **"Embarius."**

Inside the helmet, a **skull remained lodged**. As Golden pried it free, the jawbone **snapped off**.

And then… A piercing **shriek** shattered the air.

### The Wight Awakens

Rothgar Wolfsbane had returned.

The spectral knight emerged in the courtyard, his ghastly presence sending chills down their spines.

Realizing that the wight sought its helmet, **Arasin recalled ancient lore**—a spirit bound by its stolen possession. Thinking quickly, Golden **offered his old helmet** as a replacement. The wight **vanished** in an instant… but the danger was not over.

The castle **began to collapse**.
### A Desperate Escape

As the ruins crumbled, the adventurers **raced for their lives**.

- Grim turned back for **Merle**.    
- Gruntha, with surprising strength, **scooped up both Grim and Merle**, sprinting toward the exit.
- **Munin was not so lucky**—crushed beneath falling rubble just **meters from safety**.
    

With sheer determination, Grim **hauled her free**, and Ariana’s magic **brought her back from the brink of death**.

As the dust settled, Gruntha stood before them, gratitude shining in her eyes.

_"I owe you my life—and Merle’s,"_ she said, handing them **a map of the Misty Vale**.

With a long rest ahead, the party set their sights on **Outskirt**, the frontier settlement on the edge of the unknown.

The adventure was only beginning.
