# Previously on The Misty Vale

## The Principal Characters

A band of adventurers bound together by survival, hard-won trust, and dangerous knowledge:
* **Moby** - mallard thief
* **Grim** *aka* Wolfshadow Durian Grimjaw - wolfkin fighter
* **Sorilea** Stormhand - human elementalist
* **Ariana** Graycape - elf animist
* **Arasin** the All-knowing - elf scholar
* **Munin** *Sexy* Urd Stormhammer - dwarf artisan
* **Golden** *aka* Garmander Griffinclaw - human knight

You are no longer simple wanderers. Multiple factions are now watching you.

---

## How This All Began

Your journey started at the **Castle of the Robber Knight**, where goblins attempted to summon the ghost of **Rothgar Wolfsbane** using a stolen helmet. By returning a substitute helm, you banished the spirit—but collapsed the castle in the process.

From the ruins, you gained:
* A **map of the Misty Vale**
* Your first warning that **ancient powers are stirring**

---

## The Key & the Dragon Emperor

In **Drakmar Pass**, you found a dying messenger in the employ of the **Master Weatherman**. With his last breath, he entrusted you with:
* **One fragment** of a **four-part statuette key**
* A map marking three other fragments
* A warning tied to **Leanara**, **the Dragon Emperor**, and a buried secret

This was your **first key fragment**.

In **Outskirt**, you learned the following:
* The statuette unlocks the crypt of **Um-Durman**, the Sword of **Eledain**
* Um-Durman can **destroy or unleash** a great demon
* **Annabella** the barmaid is part of the **Truth Society** who offers 50 gold coins per statuette fragment in order to preserve historical artifacts.

---

## The Factions in Play

Three powers now race for the key:
##### ⚹ The Keepers of the Eternal Flame
* Dragon Knights loyal to Emperor **Eledain**
* *Goal:* Prevent the demon’s return
* *You’ve met:* **Alfilia Shadowleaf**
##### ⚹ The Followers of Sathmog / Azrahel Koth
* Demon cultists using spies, hidden messages, and blood magic
* *Goal:* Free their three-tongued master using Um-Durman
##### ⚹ The Orcs & Goblins of the Vale (Chief **Maladuk**)
* Secret rulers of the valley
* *Goal:* Stop the demon out of fear, not mercy
* *Status:* **Allied with you**
* *Proof phrase:* *“We have kissed Maladuk.”*

## Riddermound

Within the haunted burial mound, you learned a brutal lesson:
* Some evils **cannot be slain**
* Survival sometimes means **knowing when to flee**

From the tomb of the Dragon Knight, you recovered:
* Powerful relics
* **A second statuette fragment**

You escaped with your lives—and hard-earned caution.

---

## Bothild’s Lode

In the abandoned dwarven mine you:
* Slain **the White Death**, a monstrous sea serpent
* Reclaimed **Bothild’s Golden Axe**
* Recovered **another statuette fragment**

But there was a revelation:
* This fragment was **a duplicate** of one you already possessed
* One fragment is **real**, one is **a fake**?

This gives you leverage:
* Rivals can be deceived
* Alliances can be tested—or broken

You also forged an alliance with **Chief Maladuk**, confirming the orcs’ secret war against the cult.

---

## What You Have Now

You currently possess:
* **Two genuine statuette fragments**
* **One duplicate fragment** (identity unknown)
* Ancient weapons and relics tied to the Dragon Emperor
* Allies—and enemies—who know you are no longer insignificant

Two fragments remain **somewhere in the Misty Vale**.

---

## Unresolved Threads

* **The Oracle Cave** – A kidnapped farm boy and a dangerous seer
* **Cult Activity in Outskirt** – Spies and hidden messages remain
* **Chief Maladuk** – An uneasy but valuable alliance
* **The Sword Um-Durman** – Salvation or catastrophe

The race is underway.
The Misty Vale is watching.
And the key is already in your hands.
